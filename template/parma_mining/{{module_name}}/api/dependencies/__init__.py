"""This package contains dependency functions used across the endpoints.

These dependencies are designed to provide reusable utility functions, such as
authentication and authorization checks, that can be injected into FastAPI route
handlers. By centralizing these dependencies, the application's code remains clean,
modular, and easy to maintain. Each module in this package is tailored to specific sets
of functionalities.
